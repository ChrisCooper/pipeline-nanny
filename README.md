pipeline-nanny
==============

A tool for overseeing cluster jobs n'stuff


Overview
--------
Pipeline Nanny visualizes run statuses and statistics of distributed pipelines. The goal is to have a friendlier, more understandable interface then the command line tools offered by e.g. SGE.

This visualizer should have a REST interface so it's decoupled from the actual engine/framework.
